If you can show that you can support yourself, have a good reason to want to visit, and show that you have ties, obligations, and good reasons why you will return form your visit. They will issue a visa, but it will be upto the officer at the window. I do not think the NOC is even one of the requirements, that is a Qatar thing.

Since u dont hv manufacturing defect, i think on paper u cannot.<br><br>If box is not opened yet.<br>   Can be easily exchanged.<br>Else if box is opened but not torned<br>   Request can be made<br><br><br>Leaving papers aside, practically seeing i think should be exchanged.
