Once hes here, he should take medical examination before 30 days and then you must apply for his visa extension before 30 days. Most probably they will extend for another 2 months (total of 3months now). Then you need to seek further extension, which most probably will get rejected. You can try talking to the captain there, and may approve for another 3 months. The max is 6 months.<br><br>||', <b>Short Question:</b> Is municipal approved rent agreement need for my father in law's visit visa?<br><br><b>Full Question:</b> Is municipal approved rent agreement need for my father in law's visit visa?<br> <br>and how many months can he stay in qatar?||', <b>Response Subject:</b> RE: Is municipal approved rent agreement need for my...<br><br><b>Response Body:</b> Rental agreement is only required when you want to change from family visit visa to residence visa.
